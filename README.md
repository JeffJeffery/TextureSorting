# Texture Sorting Interface: ViSiProg

## Instructions

This interface allows a user to create groups of 9 similar textures by looking through a catalog of 3000 images. The data is saved to an AWS DynamoDB. This allows it to be referenced later and used to train an AI to perform texture analysis

#### Interface

Clicking on a texture will move it between groups. A texture will either be in your sorted group, denoted by a a green box, or will be in the unsorted set. Pressing shuffle will allow you to see additional elements of the data set, shown 50 at a time. You may only submit if you have logged in, seen 50% of the dataset, and have a texture group with 9 elements
